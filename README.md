or by COMMANDS

### Accessing /exchanges endpoint:
```
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/exchanges/{currency}/{date}
```
Example command (date should be in YYYY-MM-DD format):
```
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/exchanges/NOK/2022-06-22
```
will return a string
```
0.4455
```

### Accessing /min-max endpoint
```
$ curl  http://127.0.0.1:5000/min-max/{currency}/{n}
```
Example command
```
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/min-max/AUD/10
```
will return a dictionary
```
{"max_exch_rate":2.8445,"min_exch_rate":2.7762}
```

It contains the values of minimum and maximum exchange rate over interval of last n days.

### Accessing /major_diff endpoint

```
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/major_diff/{currency}/{ns}
```
Example command
```
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/major-diff/CHF/10
```
will return a dictionary
```
{"date":"2023-04-13","difference":"0.0948"}

```
$ python tests.py
```
You should see a message that all 8 tests were performed correctly. 
!!! Note that tests were made as for 25.04.2023 and after some time, operations 
test_min_max_avg_value and test_major_diff might present other values, as they operate on constantly changing data !!!
